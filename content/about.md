# Who I am?

{{< figure src="/images/asterix.png" width=200 class="image-right" >}}

I am an Electronic Engineer, that's all.

What about an Engineer?

He likes science, technology, astronomy and space..

His job is to project and develop Embedded systems, and lives inside open source word..
Sometimes he must use windows.. but he is not happy with this.. unfortunately the most CADs runs on win platform.. and so he must use it..
when he did not use a CAD he like to use MacOs (first love, since 1997) and linux..
He also said that those who use the shell are not old, but more proficient..

Vim, or NeoVim is the only editor that people should use..

Last, not least, he likes history and art..
