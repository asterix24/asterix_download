*Isometric KeyBoard*

## What is?

Isokey is a really fully keyboard with straight *keys*!

What does "straight" keys?

This means that keys are aligned isometrically, where each key is put on a grid. Usually, in many commercial keyboards, the keys are putted in shifted rows.

## Why?

When you see your hands, you see something wrong? Do you have a non-straight finger?

Have you noticed that when you open and close your hands, the fingers move lineary?

That all to say that a common keyboard inherits from legacy mechanical typewriters. This is because in the past, the mechanical typewriter had building trouble, and to guarantee the stamp to correctly impress the char on the page, they should use some tricks. In this way, the engineers shifts keys to allow the mechanical hammer to have a fisical dimension and to have enough space to travel to paper. This was true until the typewriter was mechanical, but now with computers, this is not more true, and so we can take in account that the people's hands are straight and to have more comfortable keyboard to use.

## Why didnâ€™t you buy it already made?

Sure this is a good question.. but the reply is simply too: I did not find it to buy..

This i not really true, becouse ther are some isometric keyboards I could buy, but they are very  customized, or with minimal layout (60%, 45%..).
So to find one "normal" full isometric keyboard, I build it.

## How you did that?

Today on the market you could found all you need to make your custom keyboard, but, despite the fact that I am an Electronic Engineer, to build a keyboard fully custom is not easy. You must know mutch things, like electronics, mechanical .. and not less design..

[Here](/post/isokey/) I will describe the various steps that need to be done to build your custom keyboard.

## How much does it cost?

Time ago I heard that: if you ask the price of something, that means you do not have enough money to buy it..

Building your custom keyboard is expensive.. considering only the cost of various pieces, without considering how many hours of work need to do this..

In my [posts](/post/isokey/) I show you all the tricks that you need to try to save money..

Despite the money and the time that you spend, the result is very appreciated.. and is fun!
