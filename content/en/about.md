I am an Electronic Engineer... nothing more...

## What to say about an Engineer?

He likes science, technology, astronomy and space....

He is fascinated by the OpenSource world and its principles, for work he uses them regularly... even if sometimes he has to use windows...

When he doesn't have to use windows, he likes to use MacOS (his love since 1997) and Linux... and he often says that shell users are not old but more productive...

Vim or NeoVim are the only editors you can use....

Last but not least, he likes history and art...
